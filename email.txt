Hi ,

Thank you for taking time to visit FlipKarma.

I hope you have found the project you were looking for. If you are still in confusion, please let me know. I will try to find the required project or connect you to the right person.

FlipKarma is an initiative to provide open access to projects/researches. We are in process of building an open community where students from different colleges and universities can share their works with each other. We believe that such collaboration would ultimately help in upgrading the quality of our works.

Please feel free to reply to this email if you have any queries or feedbacks. As they say 'feedback is fuel for champion', it will help us in getting better and better.
Thank you,
